- **Course:** [MDIS](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/UCURR_GERAL.FICHA_UC_VIEW?pv_ocorrencia_id=419984) (Discrete Mathematics)
- **Subjects:** Discrete mathematics - Formal proofing, theory of computing, knowledge representation, security and encryption
- **Tools:** Tarski's World, Fitch, Boole
- **Course grade:** 19/20

In this course several programs from the [Language, Proof and Logic](https://www.gradegrinder.net/Products/lpl-index.html) software suite are used, including:
- *Tarski's World*, a visual introduction to the language of first-order logic.
- *Fitch*, a tool for building and checking formal proofs. 
- *Boole*, a program to aid creating truth-tables.

You can download the installers from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wqOt26hPS3a-fYxNDCUDqZwGMn343ypH?usp=sharing). Please read `INSTALL.md` to select the appropriate installer.

`.prf` files are formal proofs, and should be opened with Fitch. `.tt` files are truth tables, and should be opened with Boole.
