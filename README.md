# MDIS exercises

In this course several programs from the [Language, Proof and Logic](https://www.gradegrinder.net/Products/lpl-index.html) software suite are used, including:
- *Tarski's World*, a visual introduction to the language of first-order logic.
- *Fitch*, a tool for building and checking formal proofs. 
- *Boole*, a program to aid creating truth-tables.

You can download the installers from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wqOt26hPS3a-fYxNDCUDqZwGMn343ypH?usp=sharing). Please read `INSTALL.md` to select the appropriate installer.

`.prf` files are formal proofs, and should be opened with Fitch. `.tt` files are truth tables, and should be opened with Boole.
